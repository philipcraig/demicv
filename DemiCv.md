# Experience

## SEN Teaching Assistant 08/2018 - 01/2019
Ark All Saints Academy - Greater London, England

In my role at Ark All Saints Academy I independently taught a year 7 SEN Literacy class (I am now Read Write Inc certified) and assisted in Year 9 and 11 History and Science classes. I also invigilated during GCSE Exams with the SEN students. I played the role of Key worker for certain SEN Students with high need; meaning I was in contact with parents, doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, SALTs and a range of other professionals involved in the students care. I was also expected to maintain extensive records on my students progress and communicate with teachers. I was trained in safeguarding, GDPR, 'Prevent' and various other Useful programs and skills.

What I experienced in this role:
* Establish and enforce rules for behaviour, policies and procedures to maintain order among students
* Teach socially acceptable behaviour, employing techniques such as behaviour modification and positive reinforcement
* Modify the general education curriculum for special-needs students, based upon a variety of instructional techniques and types of technology
* Develop and implement strategies to meet the needs of students with a variety of handicapping conditions
* Maintain accurate and complete students records, and prepare reports on children and activities, as required by the law, district policies and administrative regulations
* Prepare, administer and mark tests and assignments to evaluate students' progress
* Confer with parents or guardians, other teachers, counsellors and administrators to resolve students' behavioural and academic problems
* Employ special educational strategies and techniques during instruction to improve the developement of sensory- and perceptual-motor skills, language, cognition and memory
* Instruct through lectures, discussions and demonstrations in one or more subjects, such as Literacy, Science and History
* Prepare material and classrooms for class activities
* Prepare students for later years by encouraging them to explore learning opportunites and to persevere with challenging tasks
* Meet parents and guardians to discuss their priorities and the resources that they need
* Establish clear objectives for all lessons, units and projects, and communicate those objectives to students

## Youth Worker 03/2019 - 06/2018

XLP Charity - 83 London Wall, London EC2M 5ND, England

'XLP is about creating positive futures for young people growing up on inner-city estates, struggling daily with issues such as family breakdown, unemployment and educational failure, and living in areas that experience high levels of anti-social behaviuour and gang violence. Every year XLP helps thousands of young people recognise their full potential. We believe positive, long-term relationships can restore a young person's trust in people, nurture the believe that things can change and encourage them to set positive goals and work hard to achieve them'

In this role I took part in two 4 day long over night trips away, as well as a week long daytime only event. During trips and activities it was very important to make sure the yuoung people were safe and abiding by the law. I gained a lot from working with these young people with challenging behaviour. I had to demonstrate a high level of patience while still being able to maintain oprder and be understanding that acting out is due to their own personal difficulties at home. I enjoyed seeing the young people experience new things and learnt that maintaining a sense of humour and conflict management are criticial skills, especially when dealing with young people who are struggling and prone to lashing out.

Horniman Museum and Gardends - Greater London, England

What I experienced in this role:
* Describe points of interest to group members, and respond to questions
* Conduct educational activities for school children
* Monitor visitors' activities to ensure compliance with establishment or tour regulationhs and safety practices
* Provide directions and other pertinent information to visitors
